# Robinhood & CRSP Retail Investor Flow – Behavioral Analytics

## Project Overview
This project explores **retail investor behavior** using holdings data from **RobinTrack (Robinhood)** and **security identifiers from CRSP**.  
It rebuilds the entire analysis pipeline in a clean, reproducible workflow — analyzing concentration, herding, return relationships, and security mix to understand how retail flows shaped market dynamics during the 2018–2020 boom.

## Objectives
- Measure concentration and co-movement in Robinhood’s most popular tickers.  
- Analyze the relationship between retail flows and stock returns.  
- Summarize cross-sectional dynamics such as median, dispersion, and skewness.  
- Map CRSP share codes to uncover the underlying **security composition** of the retail universe.

## Key Findings
- **Herding Behavior:** Six tickers (F, GE, AAPL, MSFT, AAL, DIS) dominated holdings, with correlations above 0.9 — clear evidence of synchronized retail action.  
- **Behavior vs. Returns:** For AAL, user holdings rose while returns fluctuated, producing near-zero correlation — consistent with **cost-averaging** rather than momentum trading.  
- **Cross-Sectional Growth:** Median holdings and dispersion **tripled** between 2018–2020, showing broadening participation.  
- **Security Mix:** U.S. common shares dominate, but ETFs form the second-largest group, signaling a gradual shift toward **diversified exposure**.
